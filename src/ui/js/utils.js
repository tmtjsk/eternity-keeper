// them as a snapshot: which equipment slots a character has, what class the
// ability browser should offer from. The Identity panel edits those same stats
// live, so the snapshot goes stale the moment someone changes a class -- the
// Inventory tab would keep offering a grimoire slot to a character who is no
// longer a wizard, and the Abilities tab would keep offering a paladin's
// talents to a cipher. These read the live values instead.

 * taken from the server's list as it stands. Nothing repairs an item left in
 * a slot that stops existing -- RepairSaveLoadEquipmentErrors handles the
 * deprecated Cape and locked slots only -- which is why the character panel
 * warns about stranded gear rather than moving it.
