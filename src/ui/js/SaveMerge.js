// Folding a freshly reopened save into the UI's copy without losing the user's
// unsaved edits (invariant 12).
//
// Seven editors send the working save to a manager and get it back reopened:
// inventory, abilities, stronghold, grimoire, party, resurrection and the
// achievements toggle. Each used to merge the reply its own way, and measured on
// the running editor three of those ways lost work -- a party change reverted an
// unsaved attribute, a grimoire Apply an unsaved global, an inventory Apply an
// unsaved portrait. A two-way merge cannot get this right: "keep mine" loses
// what the server just changed, "take theirs" loses what the user just typed.
//
// Three-way can. `base` is a snapshot of what the server last sent; `mine` is
// the UI's copy; `theirs` is the reply. A value that differs between mine and
// base is the user's and is kept. Everything else comes from theirs -- which is
// how a stronghold's new Prestige, or a resurrection's cleared death flags,
// arrive. When both changed the same value the user's wins: what someone typed
// is never silently replaced.
//
// Only the scalar scopes the UI edits in place take part: each character's
// stats and portrait, the party's money and the globals. The inventory,
// abilities, stronghold and grimoire payloads are the managers' own business,
// staged and applied by them, so theirs is always the truth there. Those same
// scopes are all Save writes, so `writable` is what a Save request carries.
