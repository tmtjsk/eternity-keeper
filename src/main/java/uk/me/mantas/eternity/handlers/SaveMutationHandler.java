 * A handler that edits the working save and hands the reopened save back.

 * thing around its edit: runs on the mutation worker (invariant 9 — two edits
 * can never write the same file at once), asks {@code WorkingSave} which copy
 * of the save to edit, refuses one that is not there, records the edit as a
 * step of the save's {@link EditHistory} (what it replaces is kept, so the page
 * can undo it; a refused or failed edit puts back whatever it wrote), and
 * reopens the save through {@link SavedGameOpener} so the UI gets exactly what
 * opening it would give, with the step's id as {@code historyStep}.
 * Subclasses supply only {@link #mutate}.
 *
 * <p>These were seven copies of the same fifty lines, kept consistent only by
 * every copy remembering to do it.
