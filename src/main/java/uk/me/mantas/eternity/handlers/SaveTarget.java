/**
 * Tells the UI exactly where a save is about to land, and lets the user pick
 * somewhere else.
 *
 * <p>The file name the game uses has nothing to do with the name typed into the
 * save dialog — that one only goes into {@code saveinfo.xml}. On disk a save is
 * {@code <sessionID> <gameID> <SceneTitle>.savegame}, which is exactly why
 * people struggle to find the file they just wrote. Two actions:
 * {@code {action:"preview", oldSave}} answers with the real file name and
 * folder, and {@code {action:"choose", fileName}} asks the user for a folder
 * and stores it as the new saves location.
 *
 * <p><b>Choosing used to freeze the editor.</b> It opened a Swing
 * {@code JFileChooser} on the event dispatch thread, from inside a CEF query.
 * A modal Swing dialog with no owner disables every frame in the process — the
 * main window reported {@code enabled=False} while it was up — and it could
 * open behind whatever had focus, which left a window that ignored every click
 * with no dialog in sight to explain why. A Swing modal loop running inside a
 * CEF-hosted window is also the kind of thing that turns a hang into a native
 * crash, and that is what the user saw.
 *
 * <p>Now it uses CEF's own native Save dialog, the one Export Character has
 * always used: it is owned by the browser window and runs through CEF rather
 * than through a second event loop. The bundled JCEF has no folder mode, so the
 * dialog opens on the file name the game will actually use, and only the folder
 * it points into is kept — a save renamed here would not appear on the game's
 * load screen.
