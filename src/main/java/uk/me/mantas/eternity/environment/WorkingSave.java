/**
 * Which directory holds the current state of the save the editor has open.
 *
 * <p>The save list unpacks every save once and the editor opens that unpacked
 * directory. Managers used to edit it in place, so an Apply the user then
 * discarded was still there the next time the same save was opened from the
 * list, and a Save from that point wrote it into a file. So:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>until the first Save, the first edit copies the opened save somewhere
 *     private and every edit and read after it uses that copy;</li>
 * <li>after a Save, the directory that was written is the live one, exactly as
 *     before;</li>
 * <li>opening a save from the list forgets both and deletes the copy.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@code savedYet} is still the client's to say, because the client is what
 * knows whether this open session has saved; the server only refuses to
 * believe it when nothing was written.
