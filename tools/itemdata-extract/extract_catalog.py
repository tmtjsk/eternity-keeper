# One-time item and ability catalog extraction from the user's own Pillars of
# Eternity install. For every object bundle that holds an Item-derived component
# we resolve the real display name (DatabaseString -> *.stringtable) and export
# the inventory icon as a PNG; bundles holding an ability or a talent instead go
# into a second catalog, since the save stores those as their own objects too.
#
# The editor already reads portraits straight out of the game install; this is
# the same idea, just precomputed because parsing Unity bundles in Java 8 isn't
# realistic. Output lands OUTSIDE the git repo.
